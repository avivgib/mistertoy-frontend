            <h3 className="about-us-subtitle">About Me</h3>

            <p className="about-us-text">
                My name is Aviv Gibli, and I have always believed that toys are much more than just playthings â€” they are tools for growth, exploration, and wonder.
                With years of experience in education and a lifelong passion for creativity, I opened this store to share that joy with families everywhere.
